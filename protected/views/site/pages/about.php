        For many years, three close childhood friends from Zimbabwe were concerned about the immediate availability of basic commodities and luxury goods in their country. Living in the Diaspora, these budding entrepreneurs were exposed to the comfort of availability and choice of goods at a click of a button. It was here that Peenza.com was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        The talented trio comprising of an economist, a motion-graphic designer and a ﬁnancial analyst sought out to bring about change to their beloved homeland by creating Zimbabwe’s ﬁrst fully functional online shopping experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Peenza provides a platform for a growing population of self-employed sales people to sell their products nationwide, <br />without the logistical and geographical constraints of traditional trade. Dealers can post their products live to a national and international pool of buyers. Those looking to purchase can simply view the product, add it to the basket and purchase the product. It’s really that simple!
    </p>
    <p>
        Peenza strives to facilitate the availability of various products nationwide and has developed a secure means of payment called the <span class="greencolor">Peenza Voucher System</span>. It’s fast, safe and works just like tangible money in your wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be the first to experience a whole new shopping era in Zimbabwe. Happy shopping!
